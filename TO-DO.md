# To-do's: things that I left behind to get the challenge done

### Optmize the page configuration retrieve:

In my mind there's two ways to do it better but I had no time to implement: either implement TanStack Query to handle API calls and enable caching or migrate from `pages` to `app` approach which is a feature from Next.js 13 and enable us to use server components.

### Check for type safe

There's a lot of type inferences that I didn't like but I had no time to fix

### Unit testing

It's so important but I rather do the challenge works other than do the tests
